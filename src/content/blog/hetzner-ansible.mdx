Now that I graduated and started freelancing, I require some software infrastructure with higher availability guarantees than what I have from my basement.
Typically, an ISP selling consumer-grade internet access guarantees uptime between 95% and 99%, which is ridiculously low. I've had several outages in the past, so I do not want to rely on my consumer-grade internet to host my infrastructure.
A popular cloud alternative is Hetzner, a medium-sized German cloud provider whose principal office is just a few kilometers from my former employer in Unterföhring (Munich).
Although they do not offer any SLA, which surprised me, people online have had positive experiences overall.
Aside from that, their pricing is very competitive: if something goes wrong with Hetzner, I can still migrate away to another provider -- hopefully with minimal effort, which is what this post is about.

What kind of services do I need?

- Timetagger (time tracking)
- VideoVault (video-on-demand platform I am currently developing)
- Forgejo (self-hosted Git platform)
- something for calendar, contacts, notes

Utilities:

- Authentik (single sign-on for all other services and potential client logins)
- Traefik (reverse proxy)
- Cloudflare-companion (DNS management)
- ntfy (push notifications)

## Terraforming

Requesting a VM with code from Hetzner is trivial. They provide an awesome [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hetznercloud/hcloud/latest/docs).
One interesting detail is that I am using the Cloudflare provider to set up DNS records for the three zones I manage.
This is useful because it allows me to CNAME onto these DNS records later.
In my tfvars, I simply define:

```terraform
cloudflare_dns_records = [{
  zone_id = "zone1"
  name = "hetzner-fsn1-vm-001.shiverpeak.xyz"
  type = "A"
  proxied = false
},
{
  zone_id = "zone2"
  name = "hetzner-fsn1-vm-001.daichendt.one"
  type = "A"
  proxied = false
}
]
```

Another noteworthy aspect is that I use the null resource to call Ansible playbooks to configure the VM.
There are two playbooks: the first prepares the machine, like setting up another user, adding SSH keys, etc. And the second one is the centerpiece of this post: it installs and configures the services I need.

## Ansible Playbooking

All my secrets are stored in a vault file in `ansible/vars/vault.yml`. The configuration is stored in `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`.
A separate role installs and configures every service.

### Traefiking

Traefik is a popular reverse proxy in the cloud-native ecosystem. I like it because I can keep the DNS and proxy configurations close to the application via Docker labels.
Although Caddy is also quite simple to use, arguably even simpler than Traefik, it only provides a centralized configuration file (maybe something has changed there now?).
Traefik will automatically create a TLS certificate with ACME - Let's Encrypt for every service configured with the label `traefik.http.routers.<service>.tls.certresolver=`.

The last step is to automatically configure DNS records for the services. Traefik does not have a native way to do this, but there is a handy project called [cloudflare-companion](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-traefik-cloudflare-companion). After supplying it with an API key with access to all DNS zones, it will automatically create CNAME records on the previously defined A records.
Getting the config right was a little tricky since I needed 3 different zones (and I did not bother to read the README, mhm). The full config is [here](https://git.shiverpeak.xyz/shiverpeak.xyz/infrastructure/src/branch/main/ansible/roles/cloudflare-companion/tasks/main.yml).
Now, whenever a new service is added to the reverse proxy, the DNS records will be automatically created.

### Applicationing

All my applications are installed via Docker containers. Jeff Geerling provides a great [Ansible Role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker) for Docker, which I use to install Docker on the server.
The installation of the remaining applications went uneventful. I store each application's configuration and data in `/mnt/user/appdata/<service>`, the same way as it is managed in Unraid.
Locating every application's state inside one folder is a useful property for managing backups and restores; more on that later.

### Authenticating

Authentik is great! At work, I started to use Keycloak; however, I wanted to get my hands dirty with the newer, hipper kid on the block, Authentik.
I've got a couple Google Titan Security keys for essentially no money (3 EUR per), so I can use them for passwordless login. Passwordless login allows me to simply click the key and be logged in without needing to enter a password or even a username. Pretty cool stuff! Following [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEpT2fYGwLw) explains how to set up a passwordless login with Authentik.

Another feature I required is invitations! I do not want anyone to sign up by themselves, but I would like to be able to send a signup link to selected individuals.
Although Authentik provides a [guide](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/users-sources/user/invitations), it is not actually enough information to get it to work.
The guide is missing a crucial step: Creating a new Invitation Stage and linking it to the imported flow. Only then will the yellow warning in the Invitation's Menu disappear, and an invitation link will be generated.

VideoVault and Forgejo can be easily connected to Authentik using the OIDC provider. With just a few mouse clicks, copying over the credentials to the respective application's configuration is all that is needed.
Timetagger was harder: it does not support OIDC and has its own authentication mechanism. Luckily, Authentik covers Proxy Authentication too, where it will act as a layer in front of the application, handling authentication and authorization and setting the respective headers, which will be interpreted by Timetagger to automatically sign in the user.
Getting this to work was a bit tricky. In the end, I stuck with the embedded outpost. The full setup involved:

- Creating a new Application with Proxy Provider (forward auth single app) in Authentik
- Creating a Traefik Middleware for forward Auth ([link](https://git.shiverpeak.xyz/shiverpeak.xyz/infrastructure/src/branch/main/ansible/roles/traefik/templates/dynamic-conf.yml.j2#L15-L30))
- Assigning the middleware to the application ([link](https://git.shiverpeak.xyz/shiverpeak.xyz/infrastructure/src/branch/main/ansible/roles/timetagger/tasks/main.yml#L100))
- Making sure all the URLs are correct ;)

### Backuping

The goal is to be able to destroy the infrastructure and recreate it from scratch, all automatically.
I need to store the state of each application and restore it when the infrastructure is recreated.
A simple backup mechanism, which utilizes Backblaze B2 buckets, creates a tar.gz archive of each application's state daily, uploads it to the bucket, and deletes old backups.
When an application is reinstalled and detects its state folder is empty or missing, it will download the latest backup from the bucket and extract it to the state folder.
Simple but useful.

## Final remarks

I will keep this post updated as I adjust and tweak the infrastructure.
Thanks for reading thus far.
