When I wondered through Ekeberg in Oslo, Norway, I noticed a few things that I found interesting. As a German, some of these things came to me as a surprise, others make a lot of sense.

### 1. No underground power lines
Most of the power and utility lines are above ground. I would assume this is due to added cost burying them underground.

### 2. Rocky ground
The ground is very rocky. When walking through the forrest, there's barely any soil, mostly just huge rocks.

### 3. Big Mailboxes
I did not see a single mailbox that could not fit a package. They are all huge and can fit a package of 3-4 books easily. Meanwhile, in Germany, a mailbox can at most fit a single book. Is there some sort of regulation for this?

### 4. Great busses and trams, icky subways
How are your busses and trams so clean, new and modern, but the subways are old and dirty?

### 5. Degraded streets
Many streets in the suburbs are in bad shape. Something like that is not common in Germany. Have winters something to do with this?

### 6. Colorful plates
There seems to be multiple types of license plates. I saw a lot of green plates on larger cars. Probably related to company cars.

### 7. Lots of secondary apartments
It seems like that legislation is more permissive when it comes to renting out a basement or attic as a secondary apartment. I saw a lot of these in the suburbs. In Germany, there is so much red tape and law around renting that barely anyone bothers with it.

### 8. Old houses with chargers for EVs
There is this stark contrast between old wooden houses with a Tesla or some other modern EV parked in front and hooked up to a charger. It's funny.
