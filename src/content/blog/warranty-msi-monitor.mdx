I bought a new 32' 4k MSI Monitor for my birthday a couple of months ago. Since there was not much choice when it came to my requirements:
- IPS (or rather, not OLED),
- an integrated KVM Switch with 3 Ports,
- at least 60W USB-C power delivery,
- a higher refresh rate of >= 120hz,
- 4k, 32',
I ended up buying the MSI MAG 323UPF, albeit its 'gamer' design. The device and its productivity features are awesome, and I'm very happy with them.

One day, a couple of dead pixels appeared. I was not sure if they were dead pixels or bugs, but they were not moving. Since they were about 8 pixels in a perfect line, I assumed it was a bug, but I do not know for sure. Searching the web it seems common occurence. I was devastated.

None of the tricks online worked:
- setup another light source to lure it outside
- use a vacuum cleaner
- use canned air in various gaps
- use a suction cup

Maybe it was a juicy one and died in the middle of the screen.

I contacted MSI support, and they were very helpful. After uploading a picture, it did not take 5 minutes to receive a return label. A day later, the UPS guy picked it up at my door. The package was then delivered to Poland (I live in Germany). Once it arrived there, it only took a couple of hours until I received an email claiming that the monitor was defective, and I got a free replacement immediately. Granted, I bribed the technician with a pack of Haribo gummy bears, but I'm sure that was not the reason for the quick replacement. A little kindness goes a long way.

Kudos to MSI for their excellent support. Whether it was a bug or a dead pixel, neither should happen on a new monitor. I'm glad they stick to their warranty without any hassle.

Would buy MSI again.
