# Useful software I like

Moving away from BigTech is not an easy task. However, in these days, there are plenty polished
alternatives out there. Over the years I tried out many different services and software. I will
formulate some of my opinions here.

A very encompassing resource I recommend is [PrivacyGuides](https://www.privacyguides.org/).
